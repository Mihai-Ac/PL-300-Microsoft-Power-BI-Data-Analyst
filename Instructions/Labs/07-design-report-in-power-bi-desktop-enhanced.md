## **Get started – Open report** --- **Changed**

In this task, you'll set up the environment for the lab by opening the starter report.

*Important: If you're continuing on from the previous lab (and you completed that lab successfully), don't complete this task; instead, skip to the next task.*

1. Open Power BI Desktop.
